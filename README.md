## Parameters of Bitcoins

### Faster Block Confirmations

- With a target spacing reduced to 8 minutes from Bitcoin's current 10-minute target spacing, blocks will be mined more frequently. This adjustment could significantly expedite transaction confirmations.

### Shorter Target Timespan

- A target timespan of 16 minutes ensures a quicker completion of a set number of blocks. This change enhances the blockchain's responsiveness to network changes and enables faster adaptation to variations in hash rate.

### Network Stability and Security

- Modifying fundamental parameters may impact the stability and security of the network. Rapid changes could introduce vulnerabilities or affect the network's resilience against potential attacks.

### Economic Considerations

- Altered parameters have the potential to influence economic incentives for miners.

## Technical Specifications

- **Target Spacing:** 16 minutes
- **Target Timespan:** Approximately 22,160 minutes (1,385 blocks at 16 minutes each)
- **Faster Transaction Confirmations:** Achieved with an 8-minute block time
- **Enhanced Security:** Increased confirmations required (10 confirmations) for heightened security
- **Responsive Difficulty Adjustment:** Maintains a 22,160-minute target timespan with an adaptive algorithm
- **Economic Sustainability:** Balanced incentives for miners and controlled issuance through halving mechanisms
- **Community Governance:** Embraces decentralized governance mechanisms for active community participation
- **Scalability and Accessibility:** Shorter block time and responsive difficulty adjustment contribute to enhanced scalability and user accessibility

## Security Enhancements

### Fixed Code Words Vulnerability

- Fixed issues related to backdoor seed phrases that had the potential to expose Bitcoin wallets containing 12-word seed phrases and private keys.
- Removed issue with recovery phrase words in recent Bitcoin Core updates 2014-2023.

### Master Key Phrases Removal

- Eliminated master key seed phrases associated with Bitcoin for enhanced security in Bitcoins.

### Network Upgrades

#### Stability and Security

- Updated network parameters to ensure improved stability and security.

#### Transaction Optimization

- Achieved faster transaction times for enhanced efficiency.

#### Target Spacing Upgrade

- Improved target spacing for better overall system performance.

#### Reduced Block Time

- Implemented a shorter block time for increased responsiveness.

#### Miner Incentives

- Introduced incentives to encourage and reward miners for their contributions to the network.
