# Bitcoin Classic

## Parameters of Bitcoin Classic

### Faster Block Confirmations

With a target spacing reduced to 8 minutes from Bitcoin's current 10-minute target spacing, blocks will be mined more frequently. This adjustment could significantly expedite transaction confirmations.

### Shorter Target Timespan

A target timespan of 16 minutes ensures a quicker completion of a set number of blocks. This change enhances the blockchain's responsiveness to network changes and enables faster adaptation to variations in hash rate.

### Network Stability and Security

Modifying fundamental parameters may impact the stability and security of the network. Rapid changes could introduce vulnerabilities or affect the network's resilience against potential attacks.

### Economic Considerations

Altered parameters have the potential to influence economic incentives for miners. The controlled issuance of new coins and the halving mechanism, integral to Bitcoin's economic model, require thoughtful consideration to maintain economic sustainability.

### Community Acceptance

Forks and changes to established blockchains often face challenges in gaining community acceptance. Achieving consensus among participants is crucial for the success and adoption of any modifications.
