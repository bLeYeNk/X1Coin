## Parameters of Bitcoin Classic

### Faster Block Confirmations

With a target spacing reduced to 8 minutes from Bitcoin's current 10-minute target spacing, blocks will be mined more frequently. This adjustment could significantly expedite transaction confirmations.

### Shorter Target Timespan

A target timespan of 16 minutes ensures a quicker completion of a set number of blocks. This change enhances the blockchain's responsiveness to network changes and enables faster adaptation to variations in hash rate.

### Network Stability and Security

Modifying fundamental parameters may impact the stability and security of the network. Rapid changes could introduce vulnerabilities or affect the network's resilience against potential attacks.

### Economic Considerations

Altered parameters have the potential to influence economic incentives for miners.
