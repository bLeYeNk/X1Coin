# Bitcoin Classic

## Parameters of Bitcoin Classic

### Faster Block Confirmations:

With a target spacing of 8 minutes, blocks would be mined more frequently compared to Bitcoin's current 10-minute target spacing. This adjustment could lead to faster transaction confirmations.

### Shorter Target Timespan:

A target timespan of 16 minutes would mean a quicker completion of a set number of blocks. This change might enhance the blockchain's responsiveness to network changes and potentially enable faster adaptation to variations in hash rate.

### Network Stability and Security:

Modifying fundamental parameters can impact the stability and security of the network. Rapid changes may introduce vulnerabilities or affect the network's resilience against attacks.

### Economic Considerations:

Altered parameters can influence the economic incentives for miners. The controlled issuance of new coins and the halving mechanism play a crucial role in Bitcoin's economic model. Changes should be thoughtfully considered to maintain economic sustainability.

### Community Acceptance:

Forks and changes to established blockchains often encounter challenges in gaining community acceptance. Achieving consensus among participants is crucial for the success and adoption of any modifications.






Target Spacing: 16 minutes
Target Timespan: Approximately 22,160 minutes (1,385 blocks at 16 minutes each)
Faster Transaction Confirmations: Achieved with an 8-minute block time
Enhanced Security: Increased confirmations required (10 confirmations) for heightened security
Responsive Difficulty Adjustment: Maintains a 22,160-minute target timespan with an adaptive algorithm
Economic Sustainability: Balanced incentives for miners and controlled issuance through halving mechanisms
Community Governance: Embraces decentralized governance mechanisms for active community participation
Scalability and Accessibility: Shorter block time and responsive difficulty adjustment contribute to enhanced scalability and user accessibility
