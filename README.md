# Bitcoin Classic


<h2>Parameters of Bitcoin Classic:</h2>




    <h2>Faster Block Confirmations:</h2>
    <p>With a target spacing of 8 minutes, blocks would be mined more frequently compared to Bitcoin's current 10-minute target spacing. This could result in faster transaction confirmations.</p>

    <h2>Shorter Target Timespan:</h2>
    <p>A target timespan of 16 minutes would mean a quicker completion of a set number of blocks. This might make the blockchain more responsive to changes in the network and potentially adapt faster to variations in hash rate.</p>

    <h2>Network Stability and Security:</h2>
    <p>Changing fundamental parameters can impact the stability and security of the network. Rapid changes may introduce vulnerabilities or affect the network's ability to withstand attacks.</p>

    <h2>Economic Considerations:</h2>
    <p>Altered parameters can influence the economic incentives for miners. The controlled issuance of new coins and the halving mechanism play a crucial role in Bitcoin's economic model. Changes should be carefully considered to maintain economic sustainability.</p>

    <h2>Community Acceptance:</h2>
    <p>Forks and changes to established blockchains often face challenges in gaining community acceptance. Consensus among participants is crucial for the success and adoption of any modifications.</p>

Target Spacing: 16 minutes
Target Timespan: Approximately 22,160 minutes (1,385 blocks at 16 minutes each)
Faster Transaction Confirmations: Achieved with an 8-minute block time
Enhanced Security: Increased confirmations required (10 confirmations) for heightened security
Responsive Difficulty Adjustment: Maintains a 22,160-minute target timespan with an adaptive algorithm
Economic Sustainability: Balanced incentives for miners and controlled issuance through halving mechanisms
Community Governance: Embraces decentralized governance mechanisms for active community participation
Scalability and Accessibility: Shorter block time and responsive difficulty adjustment contribute to enhanced scalability and user accessibility

<p>Fixed the Code for key words that would unlock and potentionally open wallets with 12 seed word pharases.</p>
